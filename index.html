          My Love,<br><br>
          The day you walked into my life, the world lit up like never before.
          Your smile has become my sunshine, your voice my favorite sound, and your happiness my biggest mission.
          Every moment with you feels like home, and every day away from you feels like a lifetime.
          You’ve shown me what love is — real, raw, warm, and forever.<br><br>
          I love you more than I could ever put into words,
          and still, I’ll spend every day trying.
        </p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="letter">
        <h3 onclick="toggleLetter(this)">Forever Starts With You</h3>
        <p class="letter-content" style="display: none;">
          To the most beautiful girl in the world,<br><br>
          Every time I think about the future, you're in it — laughing, dreaming, holding my hand.
          You're not just my today — you're my always.
          The love I have for you grows deeper with every sunrise and stronger with every heartbeat.<br><br>
          I can't wait to build a life with you — full of memories, inside jokes, late-night cuddles, and dreams that come true because we believed in each other.<br><br>
          You’re my everything. My forever starts with you.

      <div class="letter">
        <h3 onclick="toggleLetter(this)">My Best Days Are You</h3>
        <p class="letter-content" style="display: none;">
          Hey baby,<br><br>
          The truth is, my best days are the ones with you in them.
          You're the reason I smile for no reason, the calm in my chaos, and the fire in my heart.
          Just hearing your voice can fix a bad day. Just thinking of you gives me strength.<br><br>
          I want to be your reason to smile every day.
          Because baby, you are mine. Always.

          Hey Cutie,<br><br>
          I think I’m addicted…<br>
          Not to coffee, not to my phone — but to you.<br>
          You're the best kind of distraction, the cutest glitch in my system, and my favorite notification.
          When I hear your voice, my brain just goes: “Yup. That’s the one.”<br><br>
          I don't need anime, I don't need pizza — okay maybe pizza —<br>
          But I always need you.<br><br>
          Stay weird, stay mine. 💕

        <h3 onclick="toggleLetter(this)">My Universe</h3>
        <p class="letter-content" style="display: none;">
          To the soul that completes mine,<br><br>
          In a sky full of stars, you're the one that makes my universe make sense.
          I could write a thousand poems and still not capture the way I feel when you look at me.
          You are light in my darkness, peace in my storms, and rhythm to my heartbeat.<br><br>
          If loving you is a story, then let it be infinite.
          Because you… you're my favorite chapter in the book of life.
        </p>

          Happy Birthday, My Love 🎉<br><br>
          Today isn't just your birthday — it's a celebration of the best person to ever exist.
          You deserve laughter that never fades, love that never ends, and a future that’s brighter than the stars.
          I’m so lucky to walk through life with you by my side.<br><br>
          I hope this year brings you more smiles than you can count and more love than you can carry — and I promise to be part of both.<br><br>
          I love you. Forever and even after. 💝
